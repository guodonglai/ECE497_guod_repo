1. Rotate Boris: In this part, I change the rotate=270 to 180 in reset.sh file.
To rotate the png, first run the normal display. Then run reset.sh, three partial
image will be shown on the screen with glitches. If you run the fbi boris command again,
it will be rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise.
2. To rotate the movie, I changed the rotate=4 to 3/2/1 in setup.sh file. Run the 
setup.sh file will rotate the movie.
3. For the image with text part, I used the tux.png file. I added my name and "tux.png"
on top of the image.
4. Wrting pixels to LCD: for this part, the program will allow user to enter
width rgb values seperately to personalize the line. The user could use the 
rotary knobs to control the horizontal and vertical moves of the line.

1. I finished this homework by co-working with Joey Pierce
2. The homework has two parts: first part is to setup temperature limit for TMP101 sensor and use an interrupt to detect the temperature and print it when the temperature reaches either Thigh or Tlow.
the second part is Etch-a-sketch on 8x8 LEDmatrix controlled by actual pushbuttons.
3. The first part print the temperature when the user heat the sensor up or cool the sensor down. For the second part, the user could just use the four buttons to add one more lighting led to the matrix in four different directions.

	Max	Average	Min	CPU usage
Kernel	478us	370us	328us	2%
Python	2.22ms	1.84ms	1.58ms	3%
C	340ns	280ns	250ns	100%
Report: Based on the performance above, C code is the fastest but it also uses a lot of CPU.
The speed of the kernel on is decent and CPU usage is low.
The Python one is the slowest one while the CPU usage is not bad.
